# React Router Nested Routes example

This repository contains a sample repository that shows how nested routes can be used to solve complex shared layout problems in react.

## Description

The project is a simulation of an app where there are multiple `Page` objects that are fetched and displayed as individual routes. The purpose of the example is to demonstrate how we can have a shared `PageContainer` component that is responsible for fetching this page data and for defining sub-routes within that page. This means we can encapsulate shared loading data and UI elements between different ways of interacting with the `Page` without having these elements appear and disappear from the screen.

The site has two top level routes

- Home `/` - Fetches all the pages so we can have a link to each page
- Pages `/pages/:pageId/*` - Top level `Page` route that renders the `PageContainer`

### `PageContainer`

Within the `PageContainer` component we render a `<PageHeader />` that has some shared UI including a breadcrumb, and a navigation for the page which link to sub-routes. We also load the page from our data layer and while loading we show "loading" and once loaded we render the sub routes themselves within this component. This has the effect that while we switch between pages the `<PageHeader />` elements do not disappear and re-render, instead the stay where they are and the loading spinner only takes the place of the current page subroute.

> Note: In a more realistic example you would want to disable the `<PageHeader />` nav so it cannot be clicked while waiting for the next page to load.

## Live deployment

This has been deployed to a live URL here where you can click around:

https://react-router-nested-routes-example.netlify.app/

Notice if you click on Page 1 from the home page the breadcrumb and the page content area initially say "Loading.." until the data has loaded. You can also click on the "View", "Edit" or "Parameters" button to switch between the three sub-routes. Then if you click on the "this is a link to page 2" then you will notice the PageHeader content stays with the breadcrumb and the main content showing "Loading..." once again until the data is loaded. One the data has been loaded for all three pages the change now become instant with no UI flicker or re-rendering of the layout.

## How it works

There are two ways to do sub-routes in react-router

### Relative routes controlled by the child component

This is what was done in this project where you have a structure like this:

```tsx
// <Routes />
function Routes(){
    return (
        <Routes>
            <Route path="/pages/:pageId/*" element={<PageContainer />} />
        </Routes>
    )
}

// <PageContainer />
function PageContainer() {
    return (
        {/* Define shared UI*/}
        <PageHeader />
        {/* Define sub-routes*/}
        <Routes>
          <Route path="view" element={<PageView />} >
          <Route path="view" element={<PageEdit />} >
          <Route path="view" element={<PageParameters />} >
        </Routes>
    )
}
```

There are two important things to note:

1. The top level route uses a wildcard `/*` at the end of it's path which means it will match all routes that start that pattern
2. The child routes use relative routes which means they **do not** include a leading `/` so are like `view` and `edit` which when combined with the top level one would result in a full route of `/pages/:pageId/view` etc.

### Nested routes with `<Outlet />`

This is not the way that it was done in this project but worth mentioning

```tsx
// <Routes />
function Routes() {
  return (
    <Routes>
      <Route path="/pages" element={<PageLayout />}>
        <Route path="/edit" element={<PageEdit />} />
      </Route>
    </Routes>
  );
}

// <PageLayout />
import { Outlet } from "react-router-dom";
function PageLayout() {
  return (
    <div>
      <nav />
      <Outlet />
    </div>
  );
}
```

The problem with this is it means that the `<PageEdit />` does not have access to any of what has been done in the <PageLayout /> component and requires you to have all of your routes and sub-routes defined in on place in a top level route component.
